# VimCompletion.jl

A sample package for autocomplete in vim based on REPLCompletion in julia stdlib.

In my [another repo](https://github.com/wangl-cc/juliacomplete-nvim-client), there are a python plugin for neovim using this package as server.

## Install

```julia-repl
(v1.1) pkg>add https://github.com/wangl-cc/VimCompletion.jl.git
```
